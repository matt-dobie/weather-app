# Local Weather App
This web app was developed as one of <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp's</a> intermediate front-end projects. The goal was to display the user's local weather conditions. I used HTML5 Geolocation to obtain location data, the Dark Sky API to provide the weather information, and the Bootstrap 4 framework to ensure that the page was available on all devices. I am especially proud of the visual design, with its bright weather-dependent colours and clean layout.
